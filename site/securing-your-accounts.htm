<span class="section">Securing your other online accounts</span>
<p>Unfortunately you will now have the task of updating all of your other accounts you use online.  If a key logger program was placed on your computer then any online credentials you use could of been stolen.  You will want to secure any of the following (and others you can think of):</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Bank accounts, PayPal, Google Checkout, Amazon Payments</li>
<li>Broker accounts</li>
<li>401k accounts</li>
<li>Company accounts</li>
<li>Employer accounts</li>
<li>Web mail</li>
<li>Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and other "monolithic" accounts</li>
<li>Online shopping (thousands of sites)</li>
<li>Medical accounts</li>
<li>Any account tied to your address, bank, or a credit card</li>
<li>Any account with personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>Video Game logins</li>
<li>RDP/SSH/Telnet/FTP credentials</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Make sure that you change the user name, password, and any secret questions.  You can place fraud alerts on your bank account and credit cards or get new cards issued.  Make sure you check your account balance statements.</p>

<span class="section">Unique user names and passwords</span>
<p>It is important that you make sure the logins for each service are unique.  Many mail providers now allow you to create temporary or throw-away e-mail addresses.  You can also use any of hundreds of web mail services, making an account for each important log in.  For unimportant logins like web forums, you can re-use a junk username and password as long as you accept that a compromise against that account will compromise all places where you re-use that account.</p>

<span class="section">1.5 billion accounts for $10.00</span>
<div class="tip-right"><b>Time Bomb</b><br>Hacked credentials may not be used immediately.  Many Diablo 3 accounts were compromised from WoW accounts mined years prior.  Regular password changes are the main defense against this.</div><p>Many people note that their account gets compromised, but their system has seemingly no malware on it, or that it has been wiped recently.   It is important to realize that a large black market exists for user credentials.  On <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay</a> you can buy CDs with billions of e-mails for $10.00.  On more shady sites, you can buy lists of user names and passwords that have been compromised in the past.  <b>If you receive spam mail at your e-mail address, then it is safe to assume every hacker knows your e-mail address</b>.</p>

<span class="section">Picking a good password</span>
<p>A good password should be resistant to password cracking techniques, such as:</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt>Brute-force</dt>
<dd>A method of password cracking where an attacker goes through every possible password within a certain set of rules.  Computers can <a href="https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm">check billions to trillions of possible passwords per second</a>.  Service providers usually limit bad logins to 3-5 a minute before locking out an account in order to avert this attack.</dd>
<dt>Dictionary Attack</dt>
<dd>An attack in which a computer goes through every word in a dictionary and tries to use it as the password.  Dictionaries exist for every language and for many fictional ones as well.  Dictionaries of common phrases, names, keyboard patterns, and idioms also exist.  A computer can go through every word in the english language before a person can blink their eye.  Also be wary of putting personal information in your password, since a compromised database could reveal these things to the attacker.  A simple cracker could then run through all the personal data as a password.</dd>
<dt>Modified Dictionary Attack</dt>
<dd>The same as a dictionary attack, except the attacker also checks for variations of the dictionary words, such as random casing, all lower case, all upper case, reverse, doubled words, tripled words, words with an affix, and words with letter substitution (such as trying the number zero where the letter "O" normally would be.</dd>
<dt>Hash Tables, Hash Chains, and Rainbow Tables</dt>
<dd><div class="tip-right"><b>Data dumping</b><br>There were many high-profile database breaches in 2011.  Was your data part of it?</div>Occasionally a database will be breached and all the user names and hashed passwords will get dumped.  These lists of usernames and hashes are bought and sold on the black market in huge lists. In addition, these breaches are not always announced or even detected.  A hash table look-up is why re-using passwords across accounts is dangerous.  In it, we compare the stolen password hash to a list of known password hash combinations.<div class="tip-right"><b>What is a hash?</b><br>A hash is a one-way mathematical function.  MD5 and SHA1 are examples of algorithms.  They are used so passwords are not kept in the database.</div>If the hashes match, then the attacker knows the password.  Once the password is exposed, the attacker will try using the log in at popular web sites, such as financial institutions, facebook, and battle.net.  A hash chain and a rainbow table are just more efficient ways to store the data from a hash table.</dd>
<dt>Shoulder surfing</dt>
<dd>Shoulder surfing occurs when a thief uses their eyes or a camera to obtain login credentials.  The best defense is to just make sure no one can see your log in credentials.  Note that a short password or PIN is much easier for a set of prying eyes to memorize than is a long and complex one.</dd>
</dl>

<p><div class="tip-left"><b>A word on entropy</b><br>The more ways you can arrange something, the more entropy (chaos) it has, and the harder it is to guess.  There are 94 keys on a normal keyboard, so why only use the ten numerical digits?  Variety is good!</div>So what is the best way to make a good password?  Simple, do not use words in the dictionary, short passwords, or keyboard patterns/rolls.  An ideal password is long and random.  You need to make sure that your password is resistant to brute forcing (long and use many different characters) and to dictionary attacks (not predictable).  Essentially, it shouldn't be too human or predictable.  If you had to guess passwords one at a time, are you more likely to try "princess" or to try "dlfewkj54&U39mqv2@" as your first guess?</p>

<p>For the following examples, note that <b>passwords that utilize patterns are theoretically easier to crack</b> than ones that are purely random non-sense.</p>

<tr>
<td>dog555555</td>
<td>dog#*&&#*&&#*&&cat55</td>
<td>The first can be found by adding simple numerical affix to common dictionary words (and the short words will be tested first).  The second has a pattern, but it is highly unlikely this pattern would be searched unless known about in advance. Treated as 20 random characters, the cracker has 2.90x10^39 possibilities to go through.</td>

<tr>
<td>password</td>
<td>fnl4@@!334fv9o23</td>
<td>The first will be cracked instantly through a dictionary.  The second is a random mashing of keys and not deterministic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>19334793268</td>
<td>born1933fought47zipWas@93268</td>
<td>The first can be brute forced in a split second.  The second is human readable, personal, and difficult for a computer to predict.  Crackers go after easy targets and likely do not have time to try to find patterns based on the human mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>newyork</td>
<td>dracularailcargreets</td>
<td>The first is likely in a dictionary and is too obviously personal.  The second uses multiple unrelated words.  Though it looks insecure, note that four random english words can make 6.25x10^22 different combinations, about the same strength as twelve random characters.  Although it is 20 characters long, a true 20 character random password would be 20 orders of magnitude stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reFK$22a</td>
<td>reFK$22areFK$22breFK$22c</td>
<td>The first is a bit weak in length, though easy to memorize.  An easy solution?  Just repeat the entire password a few times and your password is many orders of magnitude stronger to a brute force.  Do note that it is very possible for a password cracking program to generate a password, then test repetitions of it.  Consider making each copied password slightly different (like the last character) to avoid this weakness.</td>

<span class="section">Password Management</span>
<div class="tip-right"><b>Real password safe</b><br>If you write down your passwords, store them in a secure safe that stays locked!  Never leave passwords lying around your desk, home, or wallet.  If destroying papers with passwords, make sure to use a cross-cut shredder or another method that results in total physical destruction.  Identity thieves can scrounge through garbage looking for a big score.</div><p>How can one keep track of so many passwords?  One solution is to use a password manager.  This is a database of passwords that you unlock by using a master key.  The <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> software is one of the more popular personal password databases.  You can also find software for your mobile devices.  By keeping your password database on a separate device, you decrease the chance of losing all your passwords in the event of a system compromise.</p>

<p>It is also possible to just plain memorize your passwords or to use a mnemonic device that lets you reconstruct the password from a catchy and personal phrase which is easier to memorize.</p>

<span class="section">Multi-Factor authentication</span>
<p>Multi-factor authentication is using 2 or more different types of authentication to enter a system.  An example might be a password and a smart card, or a PIN and a retinal scan.  For online accounts, you usually have the options of weak multi-factor (password and secret question) or strong multi-factor (password and one-time-password token).  For WoW and other Battle.net games, Blizzard provides a security token for $6.50 USD plus shipping if international.  They also offer a mobile app for free.  Multi-factor authentication improves account security greatly since the chance of a password <b>and</b> a physical item being compromised is little to none.  You should always opt in for multi-factor authentication when it is economically feasible to do so.  The downside is that it becomes harder to tell when your login details get stolen, since the thief will not be able to gain entry.</p>
