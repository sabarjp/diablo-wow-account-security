<span class="section">What do I do now?</span>
<p>Getting your account compromised is much like having your car radio stolen.  You wonder why it happened, how it happened, and you feel strange.  The feeling that a stranger handled your property and broke into it is nauseating, and it can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>There are three things that should be done in the immediate aftermath of an account compromise:</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Secure your property</li>
<li>Survey the damage</li>
<li>File a report</li>
</ol>
</p>

<span class="section">Secure your property</span>
<p>Immediately you will want to make sure that your account is secured.  This should <b>not</b> be done on the compromised system as malicious software may be tracking your every move.  The compromised system should be taken off of the network until it is cleaned.  On another system (such as a mobile phone) you need to perform a password reset on your account and change your secret questions.  Change the user-name of the account as well if it is allowed.  Ensure that you access <a href="http://us.battle.net/en/">Blizzard's official web site</a> on a clean computer when doing these things.  You may want to consider <a href="./securing-your-accounts.htm">securing your other accounts</a> at this stage, but it is likely the damage has already been done by the time the break-in is detected.</p>

<span class="section">Survey the damage</span>
<p>You should next survey the damage done to the account and jot it down.  Try to get an estimate of the date and time when the incident occurred, or get the date and time of the last known time that you logged off.  The account recovery team will attempt to locate the time period of the compromise and roll your character, gold, and items back to a prior recovery point.</p>

<span class="section">File a report</span>
<p>Visit Blizzard's <a href="http://us.battle.net/en/security/help">web page on getting hacked</a> and submit your information into the <a href="https://us.battle.net/account/support/account-recovery.html">account recovery form</a>.  Consider firing off an e-mail to hacks@blizzard.com and contacting a Game Master (GM) in-game as well.  Provide details as best as you can as to the date, time, and items taken during the incident.  Do not post a rant in the official Battle.net forums or in the technical support forums.  Be <b>courteous</b> and everything will go smoother.</p>

<span class="section">Cleaning your system</span>
<p>There are many ways to go about cleaning your system.  The three approaches to consider are:</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Trying to purge the bad things</li>
<li>Wiping everything and start over</li>
<li>Hybrid solution (save what you can then format the rest)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Purging the garbage off your system is attractive since you will not have to start over.  The problem is that there is <b>no guarantee</b> that you will locate all of the infected files and have a clean system.  Ideally, you will take the computer off the network and boot into safe mode (restart your PC and mash the F8 key until you can pick "safe mode").  Then, using external media (usb stick, CD, DVD, etc), run a whole suite of security software on every file until you find the infection.</p>

<p>This method is time consuming and you will have to check things like USB sticks and network storage as well, since many types of malicious software propagates across networks.</p>

<p>The more extreme method is simply to format all the media in your PC (along with the boot sectors) and reload the operating system from scratch.  There is little chance of an infection surviving.</p>

<p>The last method is the one most people will opt for.  Save all your personal documents and important files to external storage, scan those files for infections, then wipe the rest of the system.  When you reinstall your OS, you can move your personal documents back to the clean PC.</p>

<p>What ever method you opt for, you will want to do a <a href="./browser-lock-down.htm">web browser lockdown</a> and an <a href="./os-lock-down.htm">operating system lockdown</a> afterwards, at the minimum.</p>

<span class="section">The waiting game</span>
<p>All you can do now is wait.  In the mean time, you should work on <a href="./securing-your-accounts.htm">securing your other online accounts</a>.</p>
