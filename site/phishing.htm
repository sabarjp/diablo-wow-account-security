<span class="section">Phishing and Social Engineering</span>
<p>Phishing is a technique where a fraudulent person poses as a legitimate one.  An example might be an e-mail which looks like it came from your bank, but actually came from the hacker.  Phishing is just one technique of social engineering, where the goal is to get someone to reveal their account credentials through misplaced trust.  A real-world example of social engineering might be someone calling an employee at a company and acting like a stock-holder or a parcel-delivery service.  They abuse trust to gain access to places and information that otherwise they could not secure.</p>

<p>For Blizzard games and Battle.net, social engineering may be the most widespread way in which credentials get stolen.</p>

<span class="section">Fraudulent e-mails</span>
<p>One popular method of phishing is the use of fraudulent e-mails.  First, the malicious party will purchase a large amount of known e-mail addresses of ebay or the black market.  Then the criminal will obtain an official e-mail from some place like a bank or from blizzard.  The e-mail then gets slightly changed so that instead of directing the user to a legitimate web site, it directs them to a fake one.  Now all the thief has to do is spoof the email so that it looks like it came from an official institution.</p>

<p>How effective is this?  Consider that one can purchase 1.5 billion legitimate e-mails for $10.00.  If 1 in 100,000 people fall for the scam, then that is 15,000 compromised accounts.  If these are battle.net accounts, then the WoW gold and Diablo 3 gold could be worth $5.00 per account on average.  The scammer just raked in $75,000 despite having a very low hit rate on their scam.  Even better, now the scammer can add these accounts that are compromised to a list and sell them to other scammers who might be more adventurous and try hitting a bank account.  Or the scammer may just hold onto the accounts until the next Battle.net game comes out and see if there is any opportunity.</p>

<span class="section">Fraudulent web pages</span>
<p>A fake e-mail usually directs the user to a fake web page.  Typically, this web page is an exact copy of an official one, except the URL is not the official address.  The web page generally asks the user to log in with their user and password.  For example, a common phishing technique is that of asking the user to sign up for a beta invite or asking the user to change their password for security purposes.  When the user enters their data into the fake web site, it will display a convincing message afterwards such as "Thank you for participating!  If you are selected for the beta we will..." or perhaps "Your password has been successfully changed".  Little does the user realize that their account data has, in fact, been stolen.</p>

<span class="section">Untrustworthy web pages</span>
<p>Some web sites do not try to look official at all.  For example, a fan website or fan forum could just be a front to mine accounts, or the owners may just sell the account information on the black market to make money on the side.   This kind of phishing relies on the user choosing the same user-name and password for both the untrustworthy site and for the service that they want to compromise.  This is yet another reason to have unique logins for everything.  Web pages that offer things like gold for real money are also prime areas to be phished, and these sites are more likely to be infested with malicious Flash and Javascript.</p>

<span class="section">Untrustworthy people</span>
<p>Phishing can take place in any form where communication is possible.  A person may pose as a official figure through instant messaging or through letters.  People may pose as "Game Masters" in World of Warcraft and ask for log in credentials.  It is important to stay vigilant and to <b>never supply your credentials to anyone, even if they look official!</b></p>

<span class="section">Account sharing</span>
<p>While there is nothing wrong with sharing your account with someone you can trust, you cannot trust that their computer use habits will keep your account safe.  Every person you share your account with is another target for scammers and multiplies the chance of your information being compromised.</p>
