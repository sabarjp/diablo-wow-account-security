<span class="section">Trojans, Malware, and Key loggers</span>
<p>The amount and types of malicious software designed to take personal credentials are limitless.  Each piece of malicious software works differently.  Some is designed to record everything that a computer does.  Others are targeted at very specific applications.  Some may replicate and distribute themselves (these may be called <b>worms or viruses</b>), while others are much more minimalistic in their scope.</p>

<span class="section">What is malware?</span>
<p>Malware is malicious software.  It has many different forms and just as many unique goals.  One type may be a visual basic script that deletes random data, then replicates through Microsoft Outlook; while another is malicious Java code that allows remote takeover of the PC. </p>

<span class="section">Trojans?</span>
<p>A trojan is a type of malware which generally opens up the computer for access by a remote party by looking like something legitimate.  Most key loggers will be classified as a trojan by anti-virus when it is found.</p>

<span class="section">So what is a virus?  Are they the same as worms?</span>
<p>A virus is malicious software that attaches itself to legitimate software.  This is the most common way to be infected by direct-downloading files, especially if they do not originate from an official source.  Note that even official sites are not immune to having their files being infected.  A virus may replicate itself.  Self-replicating programs are called worms.  Worms do not attach to other files, they stand on their own.</p>

<span class="section">Then what is a key logger?</span>
<p>A key logger is a type of malware which registers the key presses and/or mouse input of a computer and sends it to a third party.  Key loggers can have legitimate uses, such as in law enforcement, but the type we are concerned with are ones that send the key data to thieves.  A key logger can be a trojan, virus, worm, or something distinct.  They are generally very difficult to detect for two reasons.  First, they are usually re-written for a very specific purpose, and thus, their signatures change frequently.  Unless your virus software has new definitions every day, it can be tough to stay ahead of the hackers.  The second problem is that they are difficult to detect with heuristics because a lot of legitimate software has to detect keyboard and mouse input.  Key loggers are the most common method in which video game accounts are compromised.  Key loggers can either detect all key presses on the system or wait for a particular process to have focus or full-screen access.</p>

<span class="section">Where does it come from?</span>
<div class="tip-right"><b>Shady sites</b><br>Beware of visiting sites that operate outside of the law.  They have no qualms about committing other crimes like identity theft.  In addition, beware of large file hosting sites as most content is not checked for malware.</div>
<p>Many people get malware on their PC and never know where it comes from.  The possibilities are quite endless.  Malicious software can be obtained through:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Exploits in an un-patched Operating System</li>
<li>Exploits in an un-patched Web Browser</li>
<li>Exploits in other un-patched software</li>
<li>E-mail attachments</li>
<li>Through external storage</li>
<li>Over a local area network from infected systems</li>
<li>From open ports that have known exploits</li>
<li>Exploits in an un-patched Operating System</li>
<li>Through "click-jacking" in a web browser</li>
<li>Through "cross-site-scripting" in a web browser</li>
<li>Automatic downloads through software vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Through direct downloads or p2p downloads</li>
<li>By phishing malware</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The last one requires explanation.  If you read the section on <a href="./phishing.htm">phishing</a>, then you know that phishing web sites look like legitimate sites.  The very real possibility then arises of malware on your PC which is designed to facilitate phishing.  A common example is malware that hijacks your browser to force re-directs.  Malware can make your browser re-direct you to software that cleans your PC for a high price point.  With regards to Blizzard games, a browser can redirect a request for battle.net to a phishing web site that looks just like the real thing.  Any site with log in credentials can be redirected in a similar manner by malware.  It is important to remove malware and then <a href="./browser-lock-down.htm">lock down your browser.</a></p>

<span class="section">Removing malware and cleaning your system</span>
<p>The easiest way to clean your PC is to format all the partitions and start over.  The reason this is the best method is because <b>antivirus scanners are not 100% accurate</b> (check out <a href="http://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart2.php">av-comparatives.org</a> for numbers).  As you can see, most antivirus programs will miss between 2-7% of infections.</p>

<p>If you are determined to clean your infection, I suggest booting Windows into safe mode and running antivirus scans from external read-only storage.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials">Microsoft Security Essentials</a> is free for genuine copies of Windows.  Make sure to perform a complete scan and not a quick one.  Also consider scanning with something like <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free">Malwarebytes Free</a> or with a couple other virus scanners.  If you have severe malware, it is highly likely you will have problems with performing virus scans or even uninstalling software.  Microsoft or Symantec usually has articles on how to remove specific types of deeply embedded malware.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no catch-all solution for cleaning your PC.  If you just have mild key loggers, then a scan and quarantine in safe mode will remove them.  But if you have something nasty that has infected your registry and system files, then you will have a lot of work to do.  Strongly consider saving your personal documents to an external device, then wiping the rest of the system clean.  Of course, make sure you scan the files on the external device to make sure you are not bringing malware onto your new, clean build!</p>

<span class="section">I can't find any malware on my PC!</span>
<p>This is the trickiest situation to be in.  You've been compromised, but your scans are not finding anything.  There are many possibilities here:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>You might of been compromised a long time ago and the malware lost since then</li>
<li>The malware may have removed itself after collecting and sending what it needed</li>
<li>You may have fallen victim to <a href="./phishing.htm">phishing</a> and not malware</li>
<li>Your data may have been <a href="./hacking.htm">compromised elsewhere</a></li>
<li>Your anti-virus may not be able to detect the signature</li>
<li>The malware might have modified your programs to avoid detection</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The safest bet here is to save out personal documents and reformat everything.  If your computer was rebuilt recently and your account has existed for a long time, then the most likely scenario is that your data was compromised long ago, but only recently was it used.  You do not need to reformat in this case unless you want to play it safe.  Sometimes you just have to make a judgement call, but keep in mind that the best practice here is to format your system.</p>

<span class="section">What got stolen?</span>
<div class="tip-right"><b>Why not my bank?</b><br>So why was your Diablo 3 or WoW account hacked when your bank data could of been stolen?  There are two reasons.  The first is that their job is to steal battle.net accounts, not bank accounts.  Many gold farmers receive an hourly wage for this work.  The second is that hacking a bank account is a major crime that can be investigated by Interpol, while a battle.net account won't be investigated by law.</div>
<p>If you think you have been key logged, then you should assume that everything you have typed has been read by a third party.  All of your passwords and usernames for every account you use should be changed.  Of course, make sure the key logger is gone before you change passwords, otherwise your changed password will get key logged as well.  Although the thief may not use or even look at the data for like, your bank, they may be tempted to sell it to more shady individuals who do not mind riskier things.</p>
