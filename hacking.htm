<span class="section">Hacking and Cracking</span>
<p><b>Hacking</b> is the process of breaking into computer systems.  It can be legitimate, recreational, or criminal.  We are concerned only with the criminal definition.  A hacker may just "take a look", modify the innards of a system, or do some sort of criminal activity.  A "system" could be a network host, a piece of code, an executable, a database, or just about anything related to computing.  A <b>cracker</b> refers specifically to a criminal hacker, but can also refer to a person that cracks passwords or security in general.  For our usage, a <b>hacker</b> will refer to the criminal that breaks into computers, but it is also a legitimate word for those with interests in computer science, regardless of their intents.</p>

<span class="section">Exploits</span>
<p>The prototypical hacker is one that searches for exploits and takes advantage of them.  A hacker can try to break into a system like you see in the movies (by typing commands into a terminal), or more frequently, by creating scripts and malware to do this automatically.  Exploits are abused to either get remote access to the system, or to obtain data normally beyond the user's level of access.  SQL injection attacks against web sites are designed to do the latter.  With special queries against a vulnerable web site, a hacker can pull down the entire database of users and hashed passwords.</p>
<div class="tip-right"><b>SQL Injections</b><br>A SQL injection attack takes advantage of a poorly-coded web page in order to run arbitrary commands against a database.  Normally a web page only gets very specific info from a database, but this attack lets a hacker get any info they want!</div>
<p>What does this have to do with battle.net accounts?  Imagine that someone reuses their password and username across a few sites.  Later, a hacker ends up obtaining a list of user names and hashed passwords by abusing an exploit.  By brute forcing the hashes, they can find common and weak passwords to these accounts, then try to use them to log into other web sites, like battle.net.  The hacker may take a safer route instead and just sell the data for quick cash.  Many years later, it passes hands to someone who uses it on battle.net and you are compromised.</p>

<p>Less secure sites pose an even greater risk.  Imagine a fan site for Warcraft that uses account logins, but they do not hash the password and instead, store it in the clear.  Now if their database is compromised, it doesn't matter how secure that password you made is!  If you re-used the user name and password anywhere, then you are vulnerable.  Even worse, this compromise may never be detected or revealed.  Note that a detected break-in against a database must be announced to the public if it meets certain criteria, so a company is not likely to try a cover-up compared to a small fan site.</p>

<span class="section">Am I a target?</span>
<div class="tip-right"><b>The lesson</b><br>Never re-use your login credentials and you won't be an easy target.  Plus keep a second e-mail account just for registering at random unimportant sites.</div>
<p>Hackers rarely target individuals, but more commonly, large companies with an equally large amount of data to steal.  The danger here is not in Blizzard being hacked (which is possible), but in smaller and less secure sites being hacked.  Many people re-use their login credentials across multiple sites, so by targeting the weakest site, a hacker can compromise accounts in larger and more secure sites (like battle.net).  Note that other information that you provide to a site may be taken as well, like your birth date, name, and e-mail address.  Consider providing false information for these and using a one-time e-mail address (or dedicated spam email) for non-important sites.</p>
